### **CHAT APP**

I did the chat-app with socket.io. Project has 2 branch. In main branch users and channels in array. In other branch they are in mongodb. I gave the params in query string.  `http://localhost:3000/?username=User1&channel=Party` and for the location i use geolocation api. I took the location and gave it to google maps in query string. I didin't use any .env file so you can download and run it. 
My project looking like this:
